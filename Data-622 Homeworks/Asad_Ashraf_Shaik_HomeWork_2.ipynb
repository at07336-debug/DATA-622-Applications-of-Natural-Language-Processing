Lemmatization produces proper dictionary words, such as producing → producing, material → material, and company → company. The words remain readable and linguistically correct. In contrast, stemming cuts words mechanically, often producing incomplete or non-dictionary forms such as exactly → exactli, producing → produc, glossy → glossi, and company → compani. While stemming is faster and rule-based, lemmatization is more accurate and produces cleaner, more meaningful text. Therefore, lemmatization is generally preferred for NLP tasks where word meaning matters."
